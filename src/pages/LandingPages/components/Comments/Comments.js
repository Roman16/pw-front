        comment: 'It was an amazing experience working with Amzbizon, I was really lost in my PPC spending and ACOS, So I took the help of Amzbizon. We started our campaigns on the 21st of November With 48% Acos, With good Keyword targeting and well established and optimized Bulk operation Campaigns, We shoot down to 24.71% in just 12 days, It is a miracle, I wish I could share my Screenshot here. But they have really worked on my ACOS. Thank You so much.',
